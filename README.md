# terasortingShared





Detailed explanation of how to run code


No need for any manual installations everything is provided in the directory
Use the make command to generate the first files and  compile the c code
Then after compilation, you can execute the datasets using
./mysort  64Gb.txt
  it will generate logs  and all sorted data into it
 no need for deletion of any temp files as the code takes off after code completion
 smaller than 8GB files will be using in-memory sorting and larger files will use external sorting
